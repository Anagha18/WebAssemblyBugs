      "\n",
      "The example on [this page](https://wasmbyexample.dev/examples/hello-world/hello-world.rust.en-us.html) calls `add` directly on the wasm object returned by the `init` function, but this bypasses the bindings generated by wasm-bindgen. It still works in the case of `add` because the bindings don't need to do anything clever. However, if functions with more complex signatures are added to the example (e.g. functions with string arguments), they won't work. For example:\n",

I actually assumed these syntaxes meant the same thing, and JavaScript just quietly does the wrong thing without throwing an exception. I think it would be helpful if the first example called `add` via the generated bindings, as this seems like it is always the better default.\n",

      "\n",

      "Let's say you are from a web background. Traditionally you would learn: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. HTML - For building layouts\n",
      "2. Css - For making those layouts look good\n",
      "3. Javascript - For adding interactions to those layouts\n",
      "\n",
      "In my opinion, WebAssembly would be the next step, step 4. In which, WebAssembly adds \"compuationally intensive tasks to be completed per an interaction with a layout\". Therefore, I think we can somewhat assume, **a frontend web developer will have their fundamentals down, and probably have a react app or two under their belt before coming to the docs**. And with this assumption for the case of AssemblyScript, they should at least have heard of TypeScript, and understand it is JavaScript with types. Which according to [The State of JS, 2019](https://2019.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/) is a very safe assumption to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Systems Language Background\n",
      "\n",
      "So if you are developer learning / are already know a systems level language, I think WebAssembly is \"another compile target\" for your code. \n",
      "\n",
      "In order to learn something like Rust, you probably compiled your hello world or whatever it may be, to your host machine, before trying to make it work outright with WebAssembly. Rust does present an interesting case, as \"a lot\" of non-systems language programmers are learning rust to compile directly to WebAssembly to learn Wasm. And I think this is something we should defiintely clarify. Especially because Rust already has a big learing curve, and I think Wasm will only make it (slightly) steeper. Therefore, **for Rust, let's clarify to the audience we expect them to already be familiar with some concepts, and have read through some of the book and have made some Hello World and other beginner programs before trying to jump straight into WebAssembly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd still argue for the case of something like Emscripten or C, the developer most likely did not learn C, but is already comfortable with C, and is reaching for Emscripten to compile for the web. Which seems to be the story companies are pushing anyways. Therefore, **For C, let's assume the user knows C already decently well, but it may be their first time playing with Emscripten. Thus, we just need to be clear on what flag does what more than actually explaining what a buffer is and things.\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "# Okay cool. How does that apply to our current languages?\n",
      "\n",
      "**AssemblyScript**: I personally see (and open for discussion) a lot of web devs getting into AssemblyScript. Thus, let's assume the developer is comfortable with things like NPM, and TypeScript. But just needs a bit of hand holding around the JS -> Wasm bridge, the runtime, and the parts where AssemblyScript is different than JavaScript or TypeScript. We don't have to go over specific syntax features, but the way Objects are handled (#56 ) is a little bit different compared to your normal web workflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Rust**: Rust is interesting as I covered before. And to avoid re-iterating, let's go with: \"**for Rust, let's clarify to the audience we expect them to already be familiar with some concepts, and have read through some of the book and have made some Hello World and other beginner programs before trying to jump straight into WebAssembly.\"\" And with this, we should use tools like wasm-pack and things that kind of hand hold both the Web and Rust developer, as they help both audiences quite a bit in the learning process. That being said though, for non-web Rust developers, we may actually want to expand a bit more on NPM, and general HTML and CSS as it may not be something they are not strong at.\n",
      "\n",
      "**C/C++**: Again, **For C, let's assume the user knows C already decently well, but it may be their first time playing with Emscripten. Thus, we just need to be clear on what flag does what more than actually explaining what a buffer is and things.\"**. So let's just show Emscripten stuff, and how it works, rather than concepts like pointers and buffers.
